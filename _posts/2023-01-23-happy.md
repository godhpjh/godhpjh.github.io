I call shotgun 
penny for your thoughts
it is what it is
iam swampedd
as a matter a fact
he's legit
you're almost done
that's all
give me five
hold on
one second
never better
that's too obvious
take it easy
brilliant
behave yourself
just be yourself
Let me cut to the chase
Learn the ropes
That's dope
nothing is created and nothing is destroyed
something fishy
cherry-picking
The Buck Stops Here
That bastard
have no doubt 의심의 여지가 없다
where are my manners
I don't know what came over me
music to my ears
It's a long shot
Heads will roll
my money back ....
right up my alley
back in my day
on my way
